# Radix Themes for Flutter

Unofficial Radix Themes 3.0 components for Flutter. A pre-styled, minimal-configuration library that follows the community Figma edition.

> It is compatible to mix `radix_themes` widgets with Flutter's standard `MaterialApp` or `CupertinoApp`.

> Radix's classic variant components use inner shadow. Because Flutter does not natively support inner shadow, components that have this classic variant are currently unsupported.
